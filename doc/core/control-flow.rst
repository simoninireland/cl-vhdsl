Control flow
============

``progn``
---------

The ``progn`` form, as in Lisp, collects several other forms together
as a unit. It is mainly used in constructs like ``if`` where an arm
must be made from a single form.


``@``
-----

The ``@`` form is specific to Verilisp.

Chip logic often needs to be "sensitised" by changes in a specific set
of wires or values: a classic example is for synchronous components
whose behaviours only happen on clock edges. The ``@`` form guards a
body of forms with a sensitivity list of wires whose changes control
when the body is executed.

.. code-block:: lisp

   ;; whenever the CLK line changes
   (@ clk
      (setf a (* a b 2)))

   ;;; when the CLK line transitions to positive
   (@ (posedge clk)
      (setf a (* a b 2)))

   ;; when one of several conditions happens
   (@ ((posedge clk) opcode)
      (setf a (* a b 2)))

In this code the body of the ``@`` will be executed whenever there is
a positive (rising) edge on the ``clk`` pin. The sensitivity list can
contain several pins, making the block sensitive to changes in any of
them.

As shown above, sensitivities can be expressed in three ways:

- As a single variable for the wires
- As a single edge trigger expression (see below)
- As a list of variables and/or edge triggers


``posedge`` and ``negedge``
---------------------------

These two operators can *only* appear in sensitivity lists. They set the
``@`` block to be sensitive to positive (rising) or negative (falling)
edges respectively on a wire.
