Verilisp core
=============

Verilisp is a domain-specific language embedded into Common Lisp. It
represents the "synthesisable fragment" of Lisp: the sub-set of Lisp
forms that can be synthesised to an FPGA or similar hardware.
Essentially you can think of Verilisp as a Lisp-like alternative to
Verilog -- and indeed Verilisp works by synthesising a Verilog program
from the Verilisp code.

This may not seem very useful, but because Verilisp code is embedded
into Lisp we have all the power of Lisp available to generate Verilisp
code. As long as the result is Verilisp we can use *any* Lisp code to
generate it. Specifically we can define macros that expand Lisp code
into Verilisp code. The result is that we can easily extend Verilisp with
new language constructs, as long as they expand into the core
synthesisable fragment.


Types
-----

Verilisp leverages Lisp's type system by adding types appropriate for
hardware synthesis.

.. toctree::

   core/fixed-width


Core forms
----------

The core of Verilisp covers all the constructs that can be directly
synthesised. It includes basic control flow, conditional, and maths
capabilities, as well as decomposition of code into modules and checks
on the types passed to operators.

.. toctree::

   core/binders
   core/rep-spec-binders
   core/assignment
   core/control-flow
   core/operators
   core/conditionals
   core/arrays


Extended forms
--------------

Verilisp is still Lisp and so can use macros to extend the core
language. This includes using familiar macros that extend the
language, as well as some that provide features important for hardware
synthesis that nonetheless don't need to be core language features.

   core/cond
   core/with-bitfields
