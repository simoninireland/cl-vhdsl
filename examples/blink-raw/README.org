* Blink in RTLisp

  This is one of the classic "blink the LEDs" programs written in
  RTLisp, closely modelled on the many Verilog examples of the same
  functionality available online.

  The program is intended for the Lattice IceStick FPGA development
  board, which has a small number of on-board LEDs. The file ~blink.pcf~
  is a constraints file that binds variables (in the program) to pins
  (one the board) to make sure that they control the LEDs. These could
  be changed very simply to drive off-board LEDs.

  The ~Makefile~ includes targets to build the program and upload it. It
  uses the ~icestorm.mk~ rules that drive the ~icestorm~ toolchain,
  consisting of the ~yosys~ synthesis tool, ~nextpnr~ placement and
  routing tool, and 5the ~icepack~ and ~iceprog~ tools used to create and
  upload the resulting bitstream to the FPGA.
