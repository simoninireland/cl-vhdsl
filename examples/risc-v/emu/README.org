* RISC-V 32-bit integer core in emulation

  This file is an emulator for the RV32I core written in idiomatic
  Lisp. This gives us a reference implementation of how the core
  should behave, lets us run RV32I assembler from Lisp, and provides a
  model for how a Lisp programmer might code-up such a core when
  thinking independently of synthesis. This in turn provides a
  starting point for turning idiomatic Lisp into Verilisp.
