;; We do these with a macro that re-writes variables in the body.
;; TODO: Decide what we do if patterns don't match because of
;; incorrect 0s and 1s. My current idea is don't execute the body,
;; but that'd be a silent failure on the hardware (although it could
;; be checked in simulation)
;;
;; A better idea is to refator and have IF-LET-BITFIELDS with a failure
;; branch.
;;
;; Might also want to expand the pattern language to allow, for example,
;; (a a a (b 3) c c) as an alternative to (a a a b b b c c). The count
;; would need to be statically known.

takes multiple bits.

The pattern may also contain 0, 1, and - for literal 0, 1, and

For example:

extracted from bits 7 to 5 and 4 to 1 respectively, and
